## About

A game designed to help in learning the country names. Try to guess the 200+ names, and along the way you'll learn about some new countries.

To encourage deeper understanding of the world, this game:

* Emphasizes each individual country by orienting the globe around that country and showing it relative to nearby countries.
* Builds awareness of country relative sizes by using an orthographic projection instead of the typical mercator projection.
* Makes it easier to learn in smaller chunks by filtering based on continent.

3D globe visualization built using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) with data from [naturalearthdata.com](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).
